# DAO

## Decentralized Autonomous Organization

It's not entirely accurate, but an easy way to think about a DAO is like a big company where all the actions of the company are decided upon by Immutable, Transparent, Decentralized voting mechanisms.

This affords the users of a system the power to control and direct how it evolves over time, instead of leaving this power in the hands of centralized control, behind closed doors.

Decentralized voting/governance is the cornerstone of how these systems operate!

1. We are going to have a contract controlled by a DAO
2. Every transaction that the DAO wants to send has to be voted on
3. We will use ERC20 tokens for voting
